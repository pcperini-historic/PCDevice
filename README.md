#ITDevice#



Inherits From:    NSObject

Declared In:      ITDevice.h


##Overview##

The `ITDevice` class provides a singleton instance representing the current device. From this instance you can obtain information about the device such as assigned name, device model, and operating-system name and version.

You also use the `ITDevice` instance to detect changes in the device’s characteristics, such as physical orientation. You get the current orientation using the orientation property or receive change notifications by registering for the `ITDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification` notification. Before using either of these techniques to get orientation data, you must enable data delivery by setting the `generatesDeviceOrientationNotifications` property to `YES`. When you no longer need to track the device orientation, set the `generatesDeviceOrientationNotifications` property to `NO` to disable the delivery of notifications.

Similarly, you can use the `ITDevice` instance to obtain information and notifications about changes to the battery’s charge state (described by the `batteryState` property) and charge level (described by the `batteryLevel` property). The `ITDevice` instance also provides access to the network connection state (described by the `connectionState` property). The network connection state represents the availability of Internet communication and whether the device is connected via a mobile data connection. Enable battery monitoring or connection monitoring only when you need it.

More documentation will be added when possible.

##Properties##

**batteryLevel**

> The battery charge level for the device.

    @property(nonatomic, readonly) float batteryLevel
    
> *Discussion*

>> Battery level ranges from 0.0 (fully discharged) to 1.0 (100% charged). Before accessing this property, ensure that battery monitoring is enabled.
>> If battery monitoring is not enabled, battery state is `ITDeviceBatteryStateUnknown` and the value of this property is -1.0.
    
**batteryMonitoringEnabled**

> A Boolean value indicating whether battery monitoring is enabled (`YES`) or not (`NO`).

    @property(nonatomic, getter = isBatteryMonitoringEnabled) BOOL batteryMonitoringEnabled
    
> *Discussion*

>> Enable battery monitoring if you need to be notified of changes to the battery state, or if you want to check the battery charge level.
>> The default value of this property is `NO`, which:

>> - Disables the posting of battery-related notifications
>> - Disables the ability to read battery charge level and battery state

**batteryState**

> The battery state for the device.

    @property(nonatomic, readonly) ITDeviceBatteryState batteryState
    
> *Discussion*

>> The value for `batteryState` is one of the constants in `ITDeviceBatteryState`.
>> If battery monitoring is not enabled, the value of this property is `ITDeviceBatteryStateUnknown`.

**generatesDeviceOrientationNotifications**

> A Boolean value that indicates whether the receiver generates orientation notifications (`YES`) or not (`NO`).

    @property (nonatomic, getter = isGeneratingDeviceOrientationNotifications) BOOL generatesDeviceOrientationNotifications

> *Discussion*

>> If the value of this property is `YES`, the shared `ITDevice` object posts an `ITDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification` notification when the device changes orientation.
>> If the value is `NO`, it generates no orientation notifications. This property has no effect in the Mac OS X environment.

**model**

> The model of the device.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly, retain) NSString *model
    
**multitaskingSupported**

> A Boolean value indicating whether multitasking is supported on the current device.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly, getter = isMultitaskingSupported) BOOL multitaskingSupported
    
**name**

> The name identifying the device.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly, retain) NSString *name
    
**orientation**

> Returns the physical orientation of the device.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) ITDeviceOrientation orientation
    
> *Discussion*

>> The value of the property is constant that indicates the current orientation of the device. This value represents the physical orientation of the device and may be different from the current orientation of your application's user interface. See `ITDeviceOrientation` for descriptions of the possible values.
>> The value of this property always returns `ITDeviceOrientationUnknown` unless orentation notifications have been enabled by setting `generatesDeviceOrientationNotifications` to `YES`.
>> The value of this property always returns `ITDeviceOrientationPortrait` on the Mac OS X platform.

**systemName**

> The name of the operating system running on the device represented by the receiver.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly, retain) NSString *systemName
    
**systemVersion**

> The current version of the operating system.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly, retain) NSString *systemVersion
    
**userInterfaceIdiom**

> The style of interface to use on the current device.

    @property (nonatomic, readonly) ITUserInterfaceIdiom userInterfaceIdiom
    
> *Discussion*

>> For universal applications and cross-compiling applications, you can use this property to tailor the behavior of your application for a specific type of device.
